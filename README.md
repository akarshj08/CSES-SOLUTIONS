# CSES Problem Set Solutions in Java☕

This repository contains my Java solutions to the [CSES Problem Set](https://cses.fi/problemset/), a collection of competitive programming problems widely used to improve algorithmic skills and prepare for coding interviews and contests.

## 📁 Structure

The problems are organized into directories based on CSES sections:

## 📂 CSES-SOLUTIONS-
┣ 📂 [Dynamic Programming](https://github.com/akarshj08/CSES-SOLUTIONS/tree/main/CSES-DP%20SOLUTIONS)

Each `.java` file is named according to the problem title and includes:
- Efficient solution with clear logic
- Proper use of Java collections and standard I/O

## 📌 Topics Covered
- ✅ Dynamic Programming

## ⚠️ **Important Note**
- Some Java solutions in this repository may result in **TLE (Time Limit Exceeded)** on the CSES platform due to tight time constraints and Java's relatively slower I/O and execution speed compared to C++.
-  If you face TLE while submitting, try to-
- **Understand the logic** from the Java code
- **Re-implement** the same logic in C++ for faster execution

##  This repo is primarily for learning and practicing algorithms using Java. Competitive coders are encouraged to switch to C++ for strict runtime environments.
